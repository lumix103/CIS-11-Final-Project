# Bubble Sort Program
This program will take eight given inputs that are within the range of zero and one hundred. It will then sort using the bubble sort method and print the array to the LC-3 console.
## Installing
To run the program first, install the [LC-3 Simulator and Editor](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/student_view0/lc-3_simulator.html). Once installed, use the LC-3 Editor to assemble the main file to generate an OBJ file. 
Then use the LC-3 Simulator to load and run the OBJ file.
## Example
Once the program is running, it will prompt you to enter a number within zero to one hundred, eight times. When entering a number the backspace key, it will not register as expected. Instead, the backspace or any other key that is not a digit (besides the enter key) will halt the program. Afterward, it will sort and print the given numbers in ascending order. As shown belown:
